# cleanUCIdataset
Course Projekt for Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data

In this repository I will show how to get and clean the raw Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset found at
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip to a tidy dataset with the average
of each measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each activity and each subject.

The repository includes the following files:
* README.md:      this file
* CodeBook.md:    describes the variables, the data, and the transformations to clean up the data
* run_analysis.R: an R script to read, clean and write the data

Notes:
The script expects the Original dataset in the working directory.
